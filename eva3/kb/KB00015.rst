KB00015: A component fails to start after crash / unsuccessful upgrade etc.
***************************************************************************

.. index:: eva, startup, crash, failed, registry, uc, lm, sfa

EVA ICS versions: **3.0.0**, **3.0.1**, **3.0.2**, **3.1.0**, **3.1.1**, **3.1.2**, **3.2.0**, **3.2.1**, **3.2.2**, **3.2.3**, **3.2.4**, **3.2.5**, **3.3.0**, **3.3.1**, **3.3.2**, **3.4.0**, **3.4.1**

Problem
=======

A component (the Registry, UC, LM PLC or SFA) fails to start after an
unsuccessful shutdown (caused by a server crash, a process crash or
unsuccessful update).

Solution
========

Manually remove */opt/eva/var/<COMPONENT>.pid* file and try to start that
component once again.

This behavior is fixed in EVA ICS 3.4.2 and further versions should not be
affected.
