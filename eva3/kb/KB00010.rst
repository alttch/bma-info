KB00010: Item states are not synchronized in real-time via MQTT
***************************************************************

.. index:: item, sync, realtime, cloud

EVA ICS versions: **3.0.0**  and 3.x above

Problem
=======

Item states are not synchronized in real-time between controllers via MQTT.

Solution
========

Step 1
------

Check `MQTT notifier <https://eva-ics.readthedocs.io/en/3.4.2/notifiers.html#mqtt>`_ configuration on
both sides.

Step 2
------

Use *mosquitto_sub* or another MQTT client to make sure MQTT packets are sent
correctly:

.. code:: bash

    mosquitto_sub -d -h localhost -u eva -P test -t 'sensor/#'

Step 3
------

Make sure both nodes have time synchronized. If the target system has the
system time set later than the source, the packets from source will be ignored.

Starting from EVA ICS 3.3.2 there is an option for MQTT notifier to send
event packets from the source node without timestamps:

.. code:: bash

    eva ns uc set eva_1 timestamp_enabled 0
    eva uc server restart

Event timestamps play the very important role in data synchronization and this
option should be used **only** if there is no way to correct time difference
between EVA ICS nodes.
