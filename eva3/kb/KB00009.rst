KB00009: Difference between "-s" and "-u" Cloud deploy options
**************************************************************

.. index:: cloud, sfa, deploy

EVA ICS versions: **3.3.2**  and 3.x above

Problem
=======

Both "-s" and "-u" options for "eva sfa cloud deploy" command allow deploying
items, which already exist. What is the difference?

Solution
========

* When "-u" option is used, items are firstly completely undeployed from the
  cloud and then redeployed back.

* When "-s" option is used, existing cloud items are skipped, but their
  configurations are altered according to the deployment file.

Let us review an example of the deployment file:

.. code:: yaml

    sensor:
        tests/s1:
            controller: uc/uc1
            update_interval: 5

* If the above file is deployed with "-u" command, the item *sensor:tests/s1*
  will be re-created from scratch (including the driver assignment). Only
  "update_interval" option is changed from the default (no interval) to 5
  seconds.

* If the above file is deployed with "-s" command, the item *sensor:tests/s1*
  will keep its configuration, except "update_interval" option will be set to 5
  seconds. If the sensor item is missing, it will be created.
