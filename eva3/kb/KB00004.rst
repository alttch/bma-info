KB00004: Wrong items deployed on a secondary UC or LM PLC node
**************************************************************

.. index:: uc, lm, cloud, undeploy, deploy

EVA ICS versions: **3.0.0**  and 3.x above

Problem
=======

Wrong items were accidentally deployed on the secondary node.

Solution
========

The best solution is to undeploy all the items with the same configuration
they were deployed:

.. code:: bash

  eva sfa cloud undeploy -y deploy.yml

however sometimes the deployment file may be unavailable or the undeployment
process could take a long time.

The solution is to manually delete items from controllers.

Items can be filtered by group
------------------------------

On the secondary controllers, execute:

.. code:: bash

  eva uc destroy -g GROUP # delete BOTH units and sensors
  eva lm destroy -g GROUP # delete lvars only

Item can not be filtered by group
---------------------------------

If items can not be filtered by group or there are special items, like LM PLC
macros, cycles etc., stop the controller and use the system shell to manually
delete item configuration files / keys using a preferred way.

On the secondary controllers, execute.

For EVA ICS 3.3.2 and below:

.. code:: bash

  eva uc server stop
  cd /opt/eva/runtime

  # uc_unit.d - the directory with unit configuration files
  # uc_sensor.d - sensors

  eva uc server start

.. code:: bash

  eva lm server stop
  cd /opt/eva/runtime

  # lm_lvar.d - lvars
  # lm_dmatrix_rule.d - decision rules
  # lm_job.d - scheduled jobs
  # lm_lcycle.d - cycles
  # lm_lmacro.d - macros

  eva lm server start

For EVA ICS 3.4.0 and above:

.. code:: bash

  eva lm server stop
  eva uc server stop

  eva registry manage

  # delete all items
  # individual items / group keys can be also deleted as well
  delete -r eva3/<hostname>/inventory

  eva uc server start
  eva lm server start
