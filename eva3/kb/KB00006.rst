KB00006: Install fails on Fedora 33
***********************************

.. index:: fedora, python3.9, installation, setup

EVA ICS versions: <= **3.3.1**

Problem
=======

EVA ICS installation fails, controllers can not be started.

Solution
========

Fedora 33 has Python version 3.9 included by default, which is not supported by
EVA ICS prior to 3.3.2.  Consider either downgrading the system Python or
installing EVA ICS 3.3.2 or newer.
