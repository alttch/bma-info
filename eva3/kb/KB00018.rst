KB00018: Preventing accidental shutdowns
****************************************

.. index:: eva, startup, shutdown, crash

EVA ICS versions: **3.4.2**  and 3.x above

Problem
=======

Sometimes EVA ICS processes be shut down by accident or due to system failure.

Solution
========

To prevent such behavior on production mission-critical, systems, enable an
additional watchdog with system cron daemon (edit */etc/crontab* file):

.. code:: shell

    */1 * * * * root  /opt/eva/sbin/check-start.sh

.. note::

    The feature is available in EVA ICS 3.4.2 and above, starting from the
    build 2023020903

The above watchdog script does the following:

* checks EVA ICS registry state and restarts it if not available
* checks enabled components and restarts them if they are not running

The watchdog script aborts checks if:

* the system uptime is less than 600 seconds (10 minutes)
* there is another copy of the watchdog script running

.. note::

    To prevent conflicts, the watchdog script must be disabled in the system
    cron during updates or manual maintenance.
