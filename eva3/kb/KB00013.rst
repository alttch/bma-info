KB00013: Stop EVA ICS when Registry DB is not accessible
********************************************************

.. index:: eva, controllers, shutdown, registry, maintenance

EVA ICS versions: **3.4.0**  and 3.x above

Problem
=======

EVA ICS registry is not accessible but local EVA ICS controllers are up and
need to be stopped.

Solution
========

To forcibly stop all components, use the command:

.. code:: shell

    FORCE_ALL=1 /opt/eva/sbin/eva-control stop
