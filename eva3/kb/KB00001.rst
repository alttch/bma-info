KB00001: SFA or LM PLC with secondaries connected keeps restarting
******************************************************************

.. index:: mqtt, lm, sfa, critical, cloud

EVA ICS versions: **3.0.0**  and 3.x above

Problem
=======

The most common problem is critical timeout exception, when the primary node
tries to reload multiple secondaries at the same time via MQTT, but they are
unavailable. Check for critical exceptions in controllers' logs.

Solution
========

The default controller timeout should be larger than secondary node timeout
(can be obtained with "controller props" command), multiplied by (retries + 1).

* Increase the default controller timeout

OR

* Decrease secondary controllers' timeouts and retries
