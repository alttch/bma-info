KB00005: Timeouts during long API calls, API calls are repeated multiple times
******************************************************************************

.. index:: timeout, api

EVA ICS versions: **3.0.0**  and 3.x above

Problem
=======

* A client receives timeout error when performing a long-running API request.

* The API call is repeated multiple times, while requested once.

Solution
========

* Long API calls should be avoided at any cost.

* All critical action and command methods have an option to obtain action ID
  and check the result later.

If there is no way to avoid long API calls, and they are performed between
controllers (e.g.  action methods with *w(wait)* param), the remote controller
timeout should be always greater than max. expected "wait" timeout in the API
request. Otherwise, the primary controller will repeat the API requests to the
target continuously, up to the value of **retries** property, set for the
secondary controller.
