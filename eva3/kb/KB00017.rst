KB00017: Dealing with startup timeouts on high-loaded nodes
***********************************************************

.. index:: eva, startup, timeout, crash

EVA ICS versions: **3.4.0**  and 3.x above

Problem
=======

The default component startup timeout is 60 seconds. It may be not enough for
high-loaded nodes or nodes which run on a slow hardware.

Solution
========

Increase startup timeouts:

* The main startup timeout is located in */opt/eva/etc/eva-config*. Put there
  e.g. *STARTUP_TIMEOUT=180* to raise timeout to 180 seconds.

* If using *systemd*, edit */etc/systemd/system/eva-ics.service* and increase
  *TimeoutStartSec*. The value must be higher than the max expected timeout for
  all local controllers.

* If the startup timeout is set for more than 60 seconds, modify the watchdog
  interval and make it equal or higher:

.. code:: shell

    AUTO_PREFIX=1 /opt/eva/sbin/eva-registry-cli set-field config/watchdog
    interval 180 -p number
