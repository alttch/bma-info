KB00020: Problems with Python 3.11
**********************************

.. index:: eva, startup, shutdown, crash

EVA ICS versions: 3.x and above

Problem
=======

EVA ICS or eva-shell do not work properly with Python 3.11.

Solution
========

EVA ICS v3 is coming to EOL. Starting from Jan 1st 2023 we provide only
commercial support for Enterprise customers.

Currently there are no plans to port EVA ICS v3 to Python 3.11. Consider either
installing earlier Python version (3.8 is recommended) or switching to
:doc:`EVA ICS v4 <../../eva4/index>`.
