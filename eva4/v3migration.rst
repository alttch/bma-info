Why migrate to EVA ICS v4
=========================

* **Total refactoring**. Most of EVA ICS code has been rewritten in `Rust
  <https://www.rust-lang.org>`_ - a modern language, which provides near-C
  speeds with no safety costs. According to tests of typical customers' tasks,
  version 4 is about **50x faster** than v3.

* **New micro-core model**. With :doc:`the new model <architecture>`, all item
  logic has been moved to external services, which allows version 4 to
  process dozens of millions items on a single node, about **1000x more** than
  in v3.

* **Node scalability**. V4 node has extremely great multiprocessing support and
  memory management and can utilize as much system resources as there are
  available. Furthermore, for heavy-loaded systems, nodes can be split into
  multiple "points", by moving :doc:`services <core_svcs>` to neighbor
  computers.

* **Local clusters**. In addition to node-to-cloud formations, heavy-loaded
  nodes can be split on local points, which run on different machines. See
  :doc:`local_cluster`.

* **New AAA**. The new :doc:`aaa` architecture, much cleaner and much more
  powerful.

* **IaC and Deployment for everything**. V3 had great deployment features, but
  V4 is much better - :doc:`everything can be deployed <iac>`, undeployed and
  redeployed as on a single node, as on all selected nodes of customers'
  clouds.

* **Extension unification**. Version 3 had six types of extension. In version 4
  there is the only one type of extension - services. Which communicate with
  the core and between each other using :doc:`BUS/RT </busrt/index>` - an
  in-house IPC-bus, developed especially for high-loaded industrial
  applications.

* **Automation logic**. V3 had the only logic snippets: Python macros. In V4
  :ref:`eva4_lmacro` no longer means a Python script with lots of built-ins,
  but ANY scenario, executed by a software or hardware PLC, written in any
  language and optimized especially for customers' needs.

* **Backward compatibility**. Reborn inside, refactored outside. EVA ICS v4 is
  **99.9% compatible** with all existing HMI web applications and almost with
  all V3 Python macros.

* **Nevertheless, zero vendor lock-in**. EVA ICS is still open-source,
  open-licensed, can work with any equipment and requires no vendor-cloud
  connection. You build your cloud - you own your cloud. Private and secure.

Migration
=========

V3 nodes in V4 cluster
----------------------

V3 nodes can be connected as secondaries to V4 nodes, see
:doc:`svc/eva4-svc-repl-legacy` for more details.

The service provides all replication and interaction features, however there is
not possible to do remote deployment for V3 nodes from V4 central ones.

For the deployment tasks, consider leaving a few V3 SFA nodes and connect
secondaries to both V3 and V4 centrals.

V3 and V4 nodes on the same machine
-----------------------------------

EVA ICS v3 and v4 can live on the same machine with no problems and do not
interfere each other.

Logic
-----

EVA ICS v4 core has the minimal logic to improve its speed and scalability.

The only in-core logic is:

- **logic.range** item property, which sets the status to -1 (ERROR) if the
  value is non-numeric or out-of-range.

- lvar op functions (set/reset/clear/toggle)

- when lvar status is set to 0, the state can not be updated with RAW events,
  unless "force" field is present and set to true

.. note::

    The v4 lvar logic is different from v3: while v3 functions
    reset/clear/toggle operate with lvar value, v4 functions modify lvar
    status.

    The logic is implemented this way because v4 lvars have got "enabled"
    property, which replaces zero-status. When migrating to v4, consider
    carefully reviewing v3 macros and scripts, especially timers.

    To avoid logic confusion, it is not recommended to mix v3 and v4 lvars in a
    single cloud.

Item states
-----------

* unit nstatus/nvalue fields are removed. Instead, units now have "act" field,
  which is larger than zero if actions are pending/running.

* item expiration is handled now by external state expiration services. To let
  EVA JS framework handle lvar timers correctly, BOTH an expiration service
  must be setup plus "meta.expires" lvar field set.

* Starting from the version 4.0.2 units do not use status register for logic
  use the value register only. Actions do not accept "status", the value
  register for actions is mandatory.

AAA
---

EVA ICS v4 AAA-model is very similar to v3 but refactored

* Users are no longer created on top of API keys
* Access control lists are moved to a dedicated entity
* Both users and API keys authorization is based on top of a single or multiple
  ACLs
* ACL structure has been refactored: EVA ICS v4 no longer uses "items" and
  "groups", which had been pretty confusing but OID masks instead
* Custom authentication providers can be implemented
* The standard ACL structure can be extended by custom authorization providers
  as well
* Resource authentication has been moved to high-speed B-Tree algorithms

See :doc:`aaa` for more info.

HMI
___

General info
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* the item state field "set_time" has been changed to "t"

* the item state field "controller_id" has been changed to "node"

* the item state fields "description" and "location" are no longer available.
  Instead, use "meta" field, which can contain any customizable object.

Administration methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All system methods have been moved to :ref:`bus calls
<eva4_hmi_http__bus__TARGET_SVC__METHOD>`.

Calling methods of other services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :ref:`eva4_hmi_http__x__TARGET_SVC__METHOD`.

HMI HTTP API methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Methods were changed as the following:

==================  ============================================
V3 method           V4 Method
==================  ============================================
test                test (unchanged)
login               login (unchanged)
logout              logout ("k" parameter changed to "a")
state               item.state
state_history       item.state_history (accepts timestamps only)
check_item_access   item.check_access
state_log           item.state_log
log_get             log.get
action              action (unchanged)
action_toggle       action.toggle
result              action.result
kill                action.kill
terminate           action.terminate
run                 run (unchanged)
set                 lvar.set
reset               lvar.reset
clear               lvar.clear
toggle              lvar.toggle
increment           lvar.incr
decrement           lvar.decr
get_neighbor_list   session.list_neighbors
set_token_readonly  session.set_readonly
==================  ============================================

V3 methods, listed above, still work, but are deprecated and will be removed
soon. Please update your HMI applications to use the new method names.

Serving data from the registry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* */%pvt* URI has been replaced with **/:pvt**, as "%" in URI field may cause
  problems for certain clients.

* */%pub* URI has been replaced with **/:pub** for the same reason.

Server templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

V4 HMI service provides :doc:`tera templates <hmi/server_templates>`, which
have functionality similar to Jinja2, however some complex structures may be
incompatible. Consider testing all server templates before migrating production
applications.

V4 HMI templates have no built-in functions at the moment, for built-in
variables, see :doc:`hmi/server_templates`.

HMI tokens
~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`svc/eva-hmi` issues :ref:`session tokens <eva4_session_token>` only for
user/password pair. Tokens for API keys are not supported.

HMI web sockets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* HMI web sockets can be connected using session tokens only

* When subscribed to logs, note that "warning" level has been changed to
  "warn".

HMI PVT/RPVT
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain pvt/rpvt functions (directory listing, image processing) have been
removed. Use custom intermediate RPVT servers instead (e.g. `cctvproxy
<https://pypi.org/project/cctvproxy/>`_ for camera image processing).

:ref:`RPVT <eva4_rpvt>` calls are slightly modified to make ACLs more clear and
simple.

EVA JS Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If :doc:`/eva-js-framework/index` is used, there is no need to migrate a HMI
web application, as the framework does everything.

The only steps are required:

* update the framework to the version 0.3.40 or above.

* change names of deprecated HTTP RPC methods to the new ones (open either
  server logs or Web browser development console to see which deprecated
  methods are called)

* it is recommended to switch to :doc:`../eva-webengine/index` which is a
  successor of EVA JS Framework.

EVA WebEngine/JS Framework WASM extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The old framework WASM extension builds are not compatible with EVA ICS v4. Ask
your Enterprise pack vendor to provide a new extension tar-ball.

Python macros
-------------

* All macro functions now require OIDs, calling methods with short IDs is not
  allowed any longer.

* Macros do not have the global variable "\_source" any longer.

* Macro arguments / keyword arguments are no longer converted to
  integers/floats automatically (except if run with :ref:`eva4_eva-shell`)

* Macro extensions are no longer supported and should be converted either into
  Python modules or in EVA ICS services.

See also :doc:`lmacro/py/python_macros`.

Deployment
----------

As v4 has brand-new internal :doc:`architecture <architecture>`,
:doc:`iac` has been significantly modified. Consider migrating
deployment files.

Item scripts
------------

There are no item scripts support in v4 core, however
:doc:`svc/eva-controller-sr` provides the very same functionality. Note that
some options are changed:

* action scripts no longer receive unit id as the first argument

UDP API
-------

There is no UC UDP API in v4, however :doc:`svc/eva-controller-trap` provides
the very same functionality.
