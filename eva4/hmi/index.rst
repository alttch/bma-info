UI development
**************

Basics
======

* To interact with EVA ICS node, use :doc:`../svc/eva-hmi`, which provides HTTP
  (JSON RPC) API

* Real-time events can be taken either from a HMI service web socket from a
  pub/sub server and :doc:`../svc/eva-repl` connected to it.

Web applications
================

There is no standard of JavaScript-interface framework for EVA ICS HMI web
applications. Integrators can choose any UI-framework available or use pure
vanilla-JS.

Data of a web application can have two parts: public and private.

* **public** placed into EVA_DIR/ui, hosted by :doc:`../svc/eva-hmi`, publicly
  available.

* **private** placed into EVA_DIR/pvt, hosted by HMI service using
  :doc:`../hmi/pvt` feature.

Structured data parts can be transformed or language-translated on-the-flow.
See :doc:`../hmi/serve_as` for more details.

:doc:`../hmi/server_templates` can be used to transform other data, such as
HTML pages, on the server side.

.. note::

    It is highly recommended to use :doc:`../../eva-webengine/index`, a
    JavaScript/TypeScript framework, which is used to quickly develop EVA ICS
    HMI web applications and handles authentication, interaction, events and
    other communication tasks.

See also: :ref:`eva4_quickstart_webhmi`.

Authentication
==============

* Robot applications can use :ref:`API keys <eva4_api_key>` to call HTTP RPC
  methods.

* HMI web applications should use :ref:`user accounts <eva4_user_account>` and
  call HTTP RPC methods with a :ref:`session tokens <eva4_session_token>`.

The model
=========

.. figure:: ../schemas/ui_model.png
    :width: 745px
    :alt: UI model

* An application gets a :ref:`session token <eva4_session_token>` using
  :ref:`eva4_hmi_http__login` HTTP RPC method.

* The token can be used to call HTTP RPC methods and to subscribe to :ref:`HMI
  web socket <eva4_hmi_ws>` to receive real-time events.

* The token can be :ref:`switched to read-only
  mode<eva4_hmi_http__session.set_readonly>` for security purposes at any time.

* After the session is over, :ref:`eva4_hmi_http__login` HTTP RPC method must
  be called to end the session and destroy the authentication token.

.. note::

    It is highly recommended to use both pull (HTTP RPC
    :ref:`eva4_hmi_http__item.state`) and push (web sockets) stategies to
    handle events. Received events can be compared using *ieid* field, more
    recent
    events always have larger IEIDs.

Handling file uploads
=====================

See :doc:`../hmi/upload`.
