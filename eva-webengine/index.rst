EVA ICS WebEngine
*****************

EVA ICS WebEngine is a JavaScript set of libraries for both web browsers and
Node.js applications. It is a successor of :doc:`../eva-js-framework/index`.

* Source code: https://github.com/eva-ics/eva-webengine

* NPM package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eva-ics/webengine

* General documentation about HMI client apps: see :doc:`../eva4/ui`.

EVA ICS WebEngine is written in TypeScript. It is highly recommended to use
TypeScript instead of JavaScript to get all engine benefits (types,
auto-completion etc.).

EVA ICS WebEngine is framework-agnostic and can be used with `React
<https://react.dev>`_, `Vue <https://vuejs.org>`_ or any other modern
JavaScript framework as well as with Vanilla JS.
